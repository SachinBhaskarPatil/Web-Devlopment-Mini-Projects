Sure! Here's an example HTML code that includes the Tailwind CSS CDN link in the `<head>` of the document:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<meta charset="UTF-8">
	<title>Tailwind CSS Example</title>
	<!-- Include Tailwind CSS CDN link in script -->
	<link href="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com/dist/tailwind.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>
	<h1 class="text-4xl font-bold text-center text-blue-700 mt-10">Hello, Tailwind CSS!</h1>
	<p class="text-lg font-medium text-gray-600 text-center mt-5">This is an example of using Tailwind CSS in HTML.</p>
</body>
</html>
```
The link element in the head section of this code is used to link the Tailwind CSS CDN into the HTML file. 
By including the link to the CDN in the head section, the stylesheet (CSS) is loaded before the HTML, ensuring correct rendering of the web page. This avoids the need to install Tailwind locally and is faster to get started.
